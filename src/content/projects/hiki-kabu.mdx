I had the amazing opportunity to travel to Portugal during the winter of 2023. I was hopping from hostel to hostel, meeting wonderful people and learning of their stories. Stores are best shared around a game of cards, and one of these games originated from the Kabufuda card deck.

Hiki Kabu is one of many games played with the Kabufuda card deck. Simple and almost completely luck-based, I knew it was something I had to create to memorialize my experience in Portugal and my love for making games.

This project is sadly unfinished due to time constraints and the scope of the project. I want to return to this project one day with a simplified and clean approach, but only time will tell.
