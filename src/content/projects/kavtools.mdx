summary: "The art and self-help communities I associate myself with want tools to make learning and habit-tracking easier. Given that I needed more experience with web development, I decided to make tools for the communities that I associate myself with."

KavTools is an ongoing project to make tools for the art communities that I am apart of and to gain more experience in web development. If I am able to craft tools that solve problems in art comprehension, then I am able to simultaneously solve those problems for myself and others.

The project originally began in Unity, but I later realized that it had to be done in JavaScript, or at least some other language more closely related to web development. I then found Three.js, a library for displaying 3D environments in-browser. While it was a pretty heavy learning curve, it was extremely fun to experiment with.

Here are some of the tools and games that I want to implement by the end of this year:

**Intersection Tool:** A tool for visualizing intersections between primitive objects.

**Box Tool:** A tool for manipulating the vanishing points of boxes, as well as having a step-by-step drawing mode.

**Pose Tool:** Using machine vision, I will scan many poses of myself and others to store them in vector format. These can be then loaded on any model for pose referencing.

**Midpoint Game:** A game where the user will be prompted to 'guess' the midpoint of an object. These objects could be lines or planes.

**Degree Game:** A game where the user will be prompted to 'guess' the degree and axis of an ellipse.
