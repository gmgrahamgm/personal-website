When you grow up with video games, you'll end up wanting to make them. Ever since I began playing Garry's Mod, I've had lots of fun playing around with varying map-making concepts and gameplay features. Some of these games and maps include:

- A decades-old telecommunications bunker hosting the remenants of a past explorer's escape from society.
- A concrete jungle populated only by you, a set of puzzles, and an eerie breeze that seems to follow you wherever you go.
- A hommage to the classic Garry's Mod construct style with references to Demazure's work.
- A movement puzzle shooter combining the best aspects of SUPERHOT and Quantum Break.
- A 2D rendition of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.
