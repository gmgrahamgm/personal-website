Texas A&M offers CSE 331, Foundations of Software Engineering. While I was familiar with most of the technologies that we used within this class (Java, MySQL, Python, React), I had never worked in such a large team on such an elaborate project. The first project of the class was to make a personal website, and the remaining two projects were to make a functional POS for Panda Express in a team of 6.

The first PandaPOS project was directed using Waterfall. Our team, named RevFault, designed our MySQL database and made a desktop application with Java Swing. This application had two 'views'; Manager and Employee. The Manager view offered the ability to view store statistics, keep track of inventory, manage employees, and edit menu items. The Employee view offered the ability for any employee on a POS to input orders for customers.

The second POS Panda Express project was done via a webapp and offered three new views- a Menu, Kiosk, and Kitchen views, all somewhat self-explanatory. This project was directed via Scrum.

This class was really a trial by fire, but I learned a lot in the realm of teamwork and project management. The final web-based project ended with separate formal and technical presentations and demos.
