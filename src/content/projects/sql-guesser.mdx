CSCE 413, Software Security, is a hands-on security class that covered the fundamentals of security related concepts for software development.
Besides the many PoC's that we created, alongside studies of existing viruses, the final project was to find a zero-day exploit of an existing application or website.

## SQL Guesser

Our team found many rudementary stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities across many websites via Google Dorks, however, we only found a few websites vulnerable to SQLi.
Of these websites, we found one that errored when a malformed query was input.
Leveraging this, we created a tool called SQL Guesser.
This tool had multiple modes for guessing database, table, and column names as well as row entries.

## Binary Search

The tool would 'guess' by querying if the nth character of some database element was higher or lower than a certain ASCII value (binary search).
Since the vulnerable website did not have rate limiting or really any security checks, out team was able to map out their entire database and acquire sensitive information.
After responsibly disclosing the vulnerability, the target of the attack did not respond.

## Demos

Demos for the SQL Guesser and a rudimentary XSS keylogger have been included below.
