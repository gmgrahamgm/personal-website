After engaging with Twitch and YouTube for some time, I found both platforms lacking in tools to make streaming a seamless and efficient process.
Existing third-party services exist like Stream Elements, but lack in autonomy and privacy.
Plus, if Stream Elements goes down, so do many streams.
All of these programs were made possible by Stream Elements and its API.

## Multichat

Multichat is a program that hosts a Uvicorn webserver which continuously polls YouTube and Twitch for chat events.
Since YouTube does not have the same kind of IRC messaging system that Twitch does, I had to use Innertube to grab the chat messages themselves.
This process would have been much smoother if YouTube/Google's documentation for requesting chat messages was updated.
After chat was polled/updated, it is displayed in a webserver which can then be used on OBS.

## Media Listener

OBS does not have any native features to listen and display what media (e.g. music) is being played on stream.
There exist programs like Tuna, but these are laggy and can even be inaccurate.
I created a C# program to listen to the Windows Media player to grab the thumbnail, artist, and song title to display in OBS.

## Streamer Pad

Controlling streams (scenes, events, etc.) can be difficult with a single keyboard, but devices dedicated for streaming (like the Elgato Stream Deck) are expensive.
As such, I bought a $5 18-key USB keypad and created a program to attach itself to the keyboard and to send websocket requests to StreamerBot on keypress.
This makes controlling the stream very easy and does not interfere with existing keyboard bindings.
