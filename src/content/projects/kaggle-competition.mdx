As members of the introductory branch of the Aggie Data Science Club (A.D.S.C.), my friend Matthew Smith and I teamed up to contend in the Kaggle Data competition.

This in-house competition rewarded the team with the best regression and presentation of the selected data project. In this instance, it was the Microsoft Professional Capstone DataSet.

After much hard work, Matthew and I were able to win the competition with our regression and presentation. The concepts we learned from A.D.S.C. were invaluable towards our understanding of data science and team projects in general.
