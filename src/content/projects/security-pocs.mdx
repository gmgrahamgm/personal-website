As part of CSCE 413, Software Security at Texas A&M, each student accomplished approximately 2-3 PoCs relating to various security concepts every week, including some short essays on popular viruses and vulnerabilities. These PoCs include, but are not limited to, OWASP top 10, Google Dorks, SQLi and XSS, rudementary MITM, network scanners and port knocking, Android vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, Metasploit, password cracking, and popular tooling.

What follows is a list of these PoC's and their respective reports. Actual demo scripts can be provided upon request.
