I love when games or A.R.G.'s have unique and exciting puzzles that lead to rabbit holes. Inspired by the enigmatic Poneglyphs from One Piece, the conlang named 'Toll Text' was to be used in a now canceled final map for the game Garry's Mod.

While I still will maintain secrecy about the translation scheme of Toll Text, my goal in developing it was to completely rethink how consonants and syllables of a language are arranged visually. I plan on using the lessons learned from developing Toll Text in future projects surrounding my art and writing.
