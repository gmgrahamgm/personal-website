    "description": "<p>KavTools is an ongoing project to make tools for the art communities that I am apart of and to gain more experience in web development. If I am able to craft tools that solve problems in art comprehension, then I am able to simultaneously solve those problems for myself and others.<br><br>The project originally began in Unity, but I later realized that it had to be done in JavaScript, or at least some other language more closely related to web development. I then found Three.js, a library for displaying 3D environments in-browser. While it was a pretty heavy learning curve, it was extremely fun to experiment with.<br><br>Here are some of the tools and games that I want to implement by the end of this year:</p><strong>Intersection Tool:</strong> A tool for visualizing intersections between primitive objects.<br><strong>Box Tool:</strong> A tool for manipulating the vanishing points of boxes, as well as having a step-by-step drawing mode.<br><strong>Pose Tool:</strong> Using machine vision, I will scan many poses of myself and others to store them in vector format. These can be then loaded on any model for pose referencing.<br><strong>Midpoint Game:</strong> A game where the user will be prompted to 'guess' the midpoint of an object. These objects could be lines or planes.<br><strong>Degree Game:</strong> A game where the user will be prompted to 'guess' the degree and axis of an ellipse.</p>",

While too complex for what I am willing to write here, my heuristic solution to the game was to first create edges between all possible combinations of board tiles and then to systematically cull them (using a method much like Bellman-Ford) based on some abstract properties I defined, such as 'neediness.'<br><br>Most of this program was designed on server notepads and used to-go bags during my free time at my summer restaurant job. While I definitely carved my own path with solving this algorithm, some of the logic was inspired by 'The Complexity of Rummikub Problems' by Jan N. van Rijn et al.<br><br>The program was created using Python. The program accepts an input string of existing tiles (from both the board and your hand) and attempts to find the highest number of playable tiles while still considering tiles that have not been played yet.</p>",
